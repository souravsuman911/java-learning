🔹 6. Stateful vs Stateless Operations (Interview Topic)

Stateless

    map()  
    → Independent transformation
    
    filter()  
    → Independent filtering
    
    flatMap()  
    → Independent flattening


Stateful

    distinct()  
    → Maintains seen elements state
    
    sorted()  
    → Requires full data to sort
    
    limit()  
    → Maintains count state


## 🔹 7. Collectors – Commonly Used

Collectors are used with `collect()` to **accumulate stream elements** into a final result.

    toList()  
    → Collects elements into a List  
    → Returns: `List<T>`
    
    toSet()  
    → Collects elements into a Set  
    → Returns: `Set<T>`
    
    toMap(keyMapper, valueMapper)  
    → Collects elements into a Map  
    → Throws exception if duplicate keys
    
    counting()  
    → Counts number of elements  
    → Returns: `Long`
    
    summingInt / summingLong / summingDouble  
    → Sums numeric values  
    → Returns: `int / long / double`
    
    averagingInt / averagingLong / averagingDouble  
    → Calculates average  
    → Returns: `Double`
    
    joining()  
    → Joins elements into a String  
    → Returns: `String`

---

## 🔹 8. `groupingBy()` (Collector)

Used to **group elements based on a key**.

    groupingBy(Function)  
    → Groups elements into `Map<K, List<T>>`
    
    groupingBy(Function, Collector)  
    → Groups elements and applies downstream collector  
    → Returns: `Map<K, D>`
    
    Common downstream collectors:
    - counting()
    - summingInt / summingDouble
    - averagingInt / averagingDouble
    - mapping()
    - reducing()
    - maxBy()
    - minBy()

---

## 🔹 9. `partitioningBy()` (Collector)

Used to **split elements into two groups** based on a predicate.

    partitioningBy(Predicate)  
    → Partitions into true and false  
    → Returns: `Map<Boolean, List<T>>`
    
    Difference from groupingBy:
    - Always creates exactly two groups
    - Key type is always `Boolean`

---

## 🔹 10. `mapping()` (Downstream Collector)

Used to **transform elements before collecting**.

    mapping(Function, Collector)  
    → Applies mapping during collection  
    → Used inside groupingBy()
    
    Purpose:
    - Extract specific fields
    - Avoid collecting full objects

---

## 🔹 11. `reducing()` (Collector)

Used for **custom reduction logic** inside `collect()`.

    reducing(identity, mapper, combiner)  
    → Reduces elements into a single result
    
    Difference:
    - reduce() → stream-level reduction
    - reducing() → collector-level reduction

---

## 🔹 12. Stream Reuse Limitation

Streams are **single-use**.

Once a terminal operation is executed:
- Stream is consumed
- Reuse throws `IllegalStateException`

---

## 🔹 13. Ordering in Streams

Encounter Order:
- Maintained for ordered sources (List, LinkedHashSet)
- Not guaranteed for unordered sources (Set, parallel streams)

Order-sensitive operations:
- forEachOrdered()
- findFirst()

Order-insensitive operations:
- forEach()
- findAny()

---

## 🔹 14. Parallel Streams

parallelStream()  
→ Executes stream using ForkJoinPool

Characteristics:
- Processes elements concurrently
- Order is not guaranteed
- Best for CPU-intensive tasks

Avoid when:
- Using shared mutable state
- Performing I/O operations
- Dataset is small

---

## 🔹 15. Side Effects (Interview Red Flag)

Side effect:
- Modifying external state inside stream operations

Why avoid:
- Breaks functional programming model
- Causes issues in parallel execution
- Makes code hard to reason about

Best practice:
- Stream operations should be stateless

---

## 🔹 16. Performance Considerations

- Prefer primitive streams to avoid boxing
- Use max()/min() instead of sorting when possible
- Avoid unnecessary intermediate operations
- Streams favor readability over micro-optimizations

---

## 🔹 17. Stream API – Interview One-Liners

- Streams are lazy
- Intermediate operations execute only after terminal operation
- Streams do not store data
- Streams are not thread-safe by default
- Parallel streams require stateless operations
